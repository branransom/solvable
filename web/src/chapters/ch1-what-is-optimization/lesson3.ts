        <ol>
          <li><strong>Decision variables</strong> - what you're choosing (how many chairs and tables)</li>
          <li><strong>Objective function</strong> - what you're optimizing (maximize profit)</li>

        <p>A linear program is "linear" because both the objective and constraints are
        <strong>linear functions</strong> of the decision variables - no squares, no products
        of variables, no exponentials. Just coefficients times variables, added together.</p>
        <p>This linearity is what makes the feasible region a polygon (a <em>polytope</em> in
        higher dimensions) and guarantees that the optimal solution is at a vertex. If the
        functions were nonlinear, the feasible region could be curved, and the optimum could
        be anywhere.</p>
        <p>Linear programs can be solved very efficiently - problems with millions of variables
        are routine. Nonlinear optimization is fundamentally harder.</p>
