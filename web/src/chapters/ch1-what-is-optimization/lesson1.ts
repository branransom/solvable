        <p>Optimization is about making the best decision under constraints.
        You have a goal (maximize profit, minimize cost, reduce waste) and
        limits on what's possible (budgets, capacities, deadlines). A <strong>solver</strong>
        is software that finds the best solution automatically - you describe the problem
        mathematically, and the solver does the search.</p>
        <p>You don't write the search algorithm. You write the <em>model</em> - the
        variables, constraints, and objective - and the solver handles the rest.
        This tutorial teaches you how to build those models and understand what the
        solver tells you.</p>
        <p>Let's start with a concrete example.</p>
