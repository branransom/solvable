        <h3>When rounding is reasonable</h3>
        <p>If the LP relaxation gives x = 47.3 trucks, rounding to 47 or 48 is often
        a decent approximation. The variables are large, the rounding error is small relative
        to the total, and the rounded solution is likely still feasible (or close to it).</p>
        <p>Many practitioners use "solve the LP, round, check feasibility" as a fast heuristic
        for problems where near-optimal is good enough.</p>

        <h3>When rounding is dangerous</h3>
        <p>Rounding breaks down in two situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Binary decisions</strong>: "Open warehouse A or not?" gives x = 0.6.
          Rounding to 1 means "open it" - but 0.6 meant the LP was hedging, using a fraction
          of the warehouse's capacity. The rounded solution may violate capacity constraints
          or produce a very different cost structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Tight constraints</strong>: When the feasible region is narrow, rounding
          a fractional point can land you outside it entirely. The rounded solution is infeasible.</li>
        </ul>

        the LP optimal is an upper bound (the integer optimal can't be better, but could be much worse).
        For minimization, it's a lower bound. The gap between the LP bound and the best known integer
        solution is the <strong>MIP gap</strong> - and it's what makes branch and bound work. The solver
        uses it to prune branches that provably can't beat the best integer solution found so far.`,

        <p>The worst-case ratio between the LP relaxation optimum and the integer optimum
        is called the <strong>integrality gap</strong>. It depends on the problem structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assignment problems</strong>: integrality gap is 0 - the LP relaxation
          naturally gives integer solutions (the constraint matrix is "totally unimodular").
          You get integer solutions for free!</li>
          <li><strong>Knapsack problems</strong>: the gap is usually small. Rounding works
          reasonably well.</li>
          <li><strong>Facility location with big-M</strong>: the gap can be enormous.
          A loose big-M makes the LP relaxation nearly useless as a bound.</li>

        gap, which means less work for the solver.</p>
