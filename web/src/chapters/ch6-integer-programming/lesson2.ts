          is worse than the best integer solution found so far, <strong>prune it</strong> - no point exploring further.</li>

        <p>The key insight: the LP relaxation bound at each node tells the solver
        "the best you could possibly do down this branch." If that best-case is worse
        than a solution you've already found, you can skip the entire branch.</p>
        <p>Good formulations (tight LP relaxations) prune more branches, so the solver
        explores fewer nodes. This is why formulation quality matters more than solver tuning.</p>

      question: "A MIP solver has been running for 30 seconds. It found a solution with value 100, and the best remaining LP bound is 102. The MIP gap is 2%. Should you stop?",
      options: [
        "No - always keep running until you find the proven optimal solution",
        "It depends - 2% might be excellent or unacceptable depending on your application",
        "Yes - 2% is always good enough",
      ],
      correct_index: 1,
      explanation: `The right answer depends on context. A 2% gap means the solver has proven no solution
        can be more than 2% better than what you have. For a warehouse routing problem, that's
        excellent - the data uncertainty alone is larger than 2%. But for a large-scale supply chain
        network or capital allocation where the objective is measured in billions of dollars, 2%
        could mean tens of millions left on the table.
        <br><br>
        The key discipline: <strong>decide your gap tolerance before you solve, based on your
        application's sensitivity to optimality.</strong> Setting a MIP gap tolerance (e.g., stop
        at 1% or 5%) is standard practice. Also consider: closing the last 2% often takes 10x
        longer than getting to 2%. Is that compute time worth the improvement?`,

        <p>In the worst case, branch and bound explores 2<sup>N</sup> nodes for N binary
        variables. This is exponential, and it's not a limitation of the algorithm - the
        problem itself (integer programming) is NP-hard. No algorithm can solve all instances
        in polynomial time (unless P = NP).</p>
        <p>In practice, good formulations and modern heuristics make most problems tractable.
        But you should always:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set a time limit</li>
          <li>Set a MIP gap tolerance</li>
          <li>Monitor the incumbent (best solution found so far) - it's often very good long before the solver proves optimality</li>
