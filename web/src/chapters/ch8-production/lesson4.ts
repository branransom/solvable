        <pre><code>Presolve: 847 rows, 1203 cols, 4521 nonzeros
  243 rows removed, 118 cols removed</code></pre>
        <p>Before solving, the solver simplifies the model. It removes redundant constraints,
        fixes variables with tight bounds, and substitutes out variables that can be expressed
        in terms of others.</p>
        <p><strong>What to look for</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If presolve removes a large fraction of the model (>50% of rows/cols), your
          formulation has a lot of redundancy. This isn't a problem, but it means you might
          be able to simplify the model yourself for clarity.</li>
          <li>If presolve detects infeasibility, the log will say so immediately - you
          don't need to wait for the solve.</li>
          <li>If presolve removes very little, the model is tight. Good for solve time.</li>

        <h3>What to watch for in practice</h3>
        <p><strong>Gap not closing</strong>: if the gap stays flat for many nodes, the solver
        is exploring nodes without finding better solutions or tighter bounds. This usually means
        the LP relaxation is weak (large gap between relaxation and integer optimal). Fix the
        formulation, not the solver settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Primal not improving</strong>: the solver found one feasible solution early
        and can't find a better one. Consider providing a warm start or adding solver hints.</p>
        <p><strong>Dual not decreasing</strong>: the relaxation bound isn't tightening. The solver
        can't prune branches effectively. This often means big-M constraints are too loose.</p>
        <p><strong>Node count exploding</strong>: thousands of nodes explored per second but the
        gap barely moves. The problem has weak structure. Consider decomposition or a heuristic
        approach.</p>

        <p>The log above is from a MIP solve. A pure LP log is simpler - there's no
        branch and bound section. Instead you'll see:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Presolve</strong>: same as MIP</li>
          <li><strong>Algorithm choice</strong>: "Using simplex" or "Using barrier (interior point)."
          For large-scale LPs, barrier is often faster on a cold start but doesn't produce a basis.
          Simplex is better for warm starting.</li>
          <li><strong>Iteration count</strong>: simplex reports iteration count (number of pivots).
          A very high iteration count relative to the number of constraints suggests numerical
          difficulties or poor scaling.</li>
          <li><strong>Crossover</strong>: if barrier is used, a "crossover" phase converts the
          interior point solution to a basic feasible solution. This can sometimes take longer
          than the barrier solve itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For large-scale LPs with millions of variables, the key diagnostic is whether
        simplex or barrier is the right choice for your problem structure, and whether
        presolve is reducing the problem effectively.</p>
