        <p>An optimization model that works perfectly today can silently degrade tomorrow.
        Input data drifts. Business rules change. The model that once produced excellent
        plans starts producing plans that are feasible but bad — and nobody notices because
        the solver still says "optimal."</p>
        <p>You need monitoring that catches this.</p>

        <h3>What to monitor</h3>
        <p><strong>Solve time</strong>: Track p50, p95, and p99 solve times. A gradual
        increase means the problem is getting harder (more variables, tighter constraints).
        A sudden spike means something changed in the input data that makes the model
        harder to solve.</p>

        <p><strong>MIP gap at termination</strong>: If you're solving to a gap tolerance
        (e.g., 1%), track how often the solver hits the time limit before reaching the
        gap target. If this starts happening frequently, the problems are getting harder
        faster than you expected.</p>

        <p><strong>Objective value trend</strong>: Plot the optimal objective over time.
        If cost is increasing week over week, is it because input prices rose, or because
        the model is making worse decisions? Compare the optimizer's cost against a simple
        baseline (e.g., "do what we did last week") to measure the optimization lift.</p>

        <p><strong>Constraint slack distribution</strong>: If a constraint that used to be
        binding is now always slack, the world may have changed and that constraint is
        no longer relevant. If a constraint is always tight with zero slack, you're
        capacity-constrained and should investigate expanding that resource.</p>

        <h3>Shadow testing</h3>
        <p>Before deploying a new model version, run it in shadow mode: feed it the same
        inputs as the current model and compare the outputs. If the new model produces
        significantly different solutions, understand why before switching over.</p>
        <p>Key comparisons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Objective value: is the new model consistently better?</li>
          <li>Solution structure: are the same facilities/routes/assignments selected, or completely different?</li>
          <li>Solve time: is the new model faster or slower?</li>
          <li>Edge cases: does the new model handle extreme inputs (empty orders, zero demand) gracefully?</li>

        <h3>The trust problem</h3>
        <p>The hardest part of production optimization isn't the math — it's getting
        stakeholders to trust the output. A dispatcher who has been routing trucks for
        20 years will not blindly follow an algorithm's recommendation.</p>
        <p>Build trust incrementally:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Explain decisions</strong>: don't just output "assign order 7 to truck B."
          Explain why: "truck B is closest, has capacity, and this avoids overtime on truck A."
          Shadow prices and binding constraints are your tools here.</li>
          <li><strong>Show the tradeoff</strong>: "the optimizer saved $4,200 vs. last week's
          manual plan. Here's where the savings came from."</li>
          <li><strong>Allow overrides</strong>: let operators fix certain assignments and
          re-optimize around their constraints. This makes the tool feel like an assistant,
          not a replacement.</li>
          <li><strong>Start with suggestions, not automation</strong>: the optimizer recommends
          a plan. A human approves or modifies it. Automate only after months of consistent trust.</li>

        but the business grew. More orders, more vehicles, more warehouses = more variables and
        constraints. The fix is usually: tighten the formulation, add decomposition, increase the
        time limit, or accept a larger MIP gap. Regular model performance reviews should be part of
        the operational cadence.`,
