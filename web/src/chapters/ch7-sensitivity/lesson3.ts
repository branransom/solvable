      explanation: `When data uncertainty exceeds the allowable range, the solution is <strong>not robust</strong> to
        that parameter. The basis could change under realistic conditions, meaning a completely different
        production plan might be optimal. You should either: (1) collect better data to reduce uncertainty,
        (2) solve multiple scenarios and pick a plan that's good across all of them, or (3) use robust
        optimization techniques that explicitly account for uncertainty.`,

        <p>When sensitivity analysis reveals that your solution is fragile, there are
        more advanced techniques:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Robust optimization</strong>: optimize for the worst case within an
          uncertainty set. Gives a single solution that's good even if parameters are adversarial.</li>
          <li><strong>Stochastic programming</strong>: model uncertainty as probability distributions.
          Optimize the expected value (or a risk measure) across scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>Scenario analysis</strong>: solve for a discrete set of scenarios and find
          a solution that performs well across all of them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are graduate-level topics, but the intuition is the same: if your solution
        depends heavily on uncertain data, account for that uncertainty in the model itself.</p>
