        <p><strong>Constraints</strong>: each item assigned once, each slot gets at most one item.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective</strong>: minimize total cost (or maximize total value).</p>

        vehicle-to-route assignment, organ donor matching.</p>

        You can't assign 0.7 of a worker. Binary variables model this naturally. This is what makes
        them <strong>integer programs</strong> - and why they can be much harder to solve than pure LPs.
        We'll explore this in Chapter 6.`,
