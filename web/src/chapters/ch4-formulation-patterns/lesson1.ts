        <p>You now know how to read and solve an LP. But the hardest part of optimization
        isn't solving - it's <strong>modeling</strong>. Translating a messy real-world problem
        into decision variables, constraints, and an objective.</p>
        <p>The good news: most real problems follow a small number of recurring patterns.
        Learn these patterns and you can model almost anything.</p>

        <h3>The Three Questions</h3>
        <p>For any optimization problem, ask:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>What am I deciding?</strong> → These are your <em>decision variables</em></li>
          <li><strong>What limits my choices?</strong> → These are your <em>constraints</em></li>
          <li><strong>What am I optimizing?</strong> → This is your <em>objective</em></li>

        <p>Let's see how these questions apply to common patterns.</p>
