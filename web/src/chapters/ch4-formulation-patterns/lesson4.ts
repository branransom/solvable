        What are the units? Cost is in dollars, late deliveries is a count - you're
        adding apples and oranges. Small changes to the weights can produce wildly
        different solutions, and explaining to stakeholders why you picked those weights
        is harder than explaining the actual optimization.</p>

        The primary objective is never sacrificed for the secondary - it's a hard priority, not a
        tradeoff. Weighted sums are better when you genuinely want to trade off between objectives
        (e.g., risk vs. return in a portfolio).`,

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ε-constraint method</strong>: fix one objective at various levels, optimize

          points on the frontier. But this only finds supported points (convex parts of the frontier).</li>
