        <h3>Tip 1: Name everything</h3>
        <p>Use descriptive variable names like <code>ship_warehouse1_store3</code> instead of
        <code>x13</code>. Name every constraint. When the model is infeasible and you're
        debugging at 2 AM, you'll thank yourself.</p>

        <h3>Tip 2: Start with a simple model and add complexity</h3>
        <p>Don't model everything at once. Start with the core objective and the most
        obvious constraints. Solve it. Verify the answer makes sense. Then add constraints
        one at a time, solving after each addition.</p>

        which constraint caused the conflict.</p>

        <h3>Tip 3: Beware big-M constraints</h3>
        <p>When you need "if-then" logic (e.g., "if the warehouse is open, then it can
        ship up to 1000 units"), the standard technique uses a large constant M:</p>
        <p><code>ship_from_warehouse1 <= M * is_warehouse1_open</code></p>
        <p>If <code>is_warehouse1_open = 0</code>, then <code>ship ≤ 0</code> (can't ship).
        If <code>is_warehouse1_open = 1</code>, then <code>ship ≤ M</code> (effectively unconstrained).</p>
        <p>The danger: if M is too large (e.g., 999999), the LP relaxation becomes very weak
        and the solver takes much longer. <strong>Always make M as small as possible</strong> -
        use the tightest valid upper bound.</p>

      ],
      correct_index: 1,
      explanation: `M should be exactly 1000 - the tightest valid bound. Using 999999 is technically correct
        but makes the LP relaxation almost useless, causing the solver to explore far more branches.
        A tight M = 1000 means the LP relaxation closely approximates the integer problem, giving
        the solver much better bounds and faster convergence.`,

        <h3>Tip 4: Check your objective direction</h3>
        <p>A surprising number of real-world modeling bugs come from maximizing when you
        should minimize, or vice versa. If your "cost minimization" returns a suspiciously
        large number, check whether you accidentally wrote <code>Maximize</code>.</p>
