        <p>If you change an objective coefficient just a little, the same vertex stays
        optimal. But past a certain threshold, a <em>different</em> vertex becomes optimal
        and the solution "snaps" to a new point.</p>
        <p>The range of coefficient values where the current basis stays optimal is called
        the <strong>allowable range</strong>. Within this range, the solution point doesn't
        change (though the objective value does). Beyond it, you get a completely new solution.</p>
