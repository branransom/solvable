        <p>Solvers use floating-point arithmetic, which means they work with
        <strong>approximations</strong>, not exact numbers. Most of the time this doesn't
        matter. When it does, the symptoms are baffling: the solver says "optimal" but
        the solution looks wrong, or a constraint that should be tight has tiny slack,
        or a variable that should be zero is 1e-10.</p>
        <p>Here are the gotchas that catch engineers in practice.</p>

        <h3>1. Coefficient scaling</h3>
        <p>If your model mixes very large and very small numbers - a constraint with
        coefficients of 0.001 and 1,000,000 - the solver may lose precision. The
        condition number of the basis matrix blows up, and simplex pivots accumulate
        rounding errors.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: rescale your model so coefficients are within a few orders
        of magnitude. If costs are in dollars, don't use cents in one constraint and
        millions in another. Pick consistent units.</p>
        <p>Rule of thumb: if the ratio between your largest and smallest nonzero
        coefficient exceeds 10<sup>6</sup>, you may have problems.</p>

        <h3>2. Feasibility tolerance</h3>
        <p>Solvers have a <strong>feasibility tolerance</strong> (typically 10<sup>-6</sup>).
        A constraint <code>x + y <= 10</code> is considered satisfied if
        <code>x + y <= 10.000001</code>. This means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A "feasible" solution might slightly violate a constraint</li>
          <li>A variable with a lower bound of 0 might be -1e-8</li>
          <li>An equality constraint <code>x = 5</code> might give <code>x = 4.9999997</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: never compare solver output with <code>===</code>. Always
        use a tolerance: <code>Math.abs(x - 5) < 1e-6</code>. When passing solver
        output to downstream systems, round appropriately.</p>

        <h3>3. The "zero but not zero" variable</h3>
        <p>You expect a variable to be exactly 0 in the optimal solution. The solver
        returns 3.7e-11. Is that zero? Almost certainly yes - it's within the solver's
        tolerance. But if your code checks <code>if (x > 0) { ship_order(); }</code>,
        you'll ship an order for 0.000000000037 units.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: apply a rounding threshold before acting on solver output.
        For integer/binary variables, round to the nearest integer. For continuous
        variables, apply a threshold appropriate to your domain (e.g., quantities below
        0.01 units are treated as zero).</p>

        <h3>4. Big-M and numerical instability</h3>
        <p>We covered big-M in Chapter 4 as a formulation issue. It's also a numerical
        issue. A constraint like <code>x <= 999999 * y</code> (where y is binary) creates
        a coefficient of 999999 in the constraint matrix. This worsens the condition number
        and can cause the solver to report infeasible solutions as optimal, or vice versa.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix</strong>: as before, make M as small as possible. But also watch for
        solver warnings about numerical issues - most solvers log these if you enable
        verbose output.</p>

        it's within its integrality tolerance (typically 10<sup>-5</sup>). Round binary/integer
        variables to the nearest integer before using them in your application logic. Tightening
        tolerances can make the solver slower and may not help - floating-point arithmetic is

        <p>Signs that your model has numerical issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The solver reports "optimal" but the objective value doesn't match when you
          manually compute it from the variable values</li>
          <li>Small changes to the model (changing a coefficient by 0.001) produce wildly
          different solutions</li>
          <li>The solver log mentions "warning: large matrix coefficient" or "numerical difficulties"</li>
