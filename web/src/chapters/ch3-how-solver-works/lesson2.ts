          <li>A variable with reduced cost = 0 is <strong>in the solution</strong> (basic)</li>

        <p>What we've described - start at a vertex, compute reduced costs, pivot to the
        best neighbor, repeat - <em>is</em> the simplex method. Invented by George Dantzig
        in 1947, it remains one of the most important algorithms in history.</p>
        <p>The formal version uses matrix algebra (the "tableau") to track which constraints
        are binding (the "basis") and to compute the step direction and length. But the
        geometric intuition is the same: walk along edges of the polytope toward improvement.</p>
        <p>In practice, modern solvers use a variant called the <strong>revised simplex
        method</strong> that is more numerically stable and memory-efficient. For very large
        problems, they may also use <strong>interior point methods</strong> that take a
        different geometric approach: travel through the interior of the polytope rather
        than along its edges.</p>
