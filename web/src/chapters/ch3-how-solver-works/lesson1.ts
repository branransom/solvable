        <p>You've seen that the optimal solution is always at a vertex. So how does
        the solver find it?</p>
        <p>One approach: check every vertex. But a problem with 100 variables could have
        billions of vertices - checking them all is impossible.</p>
        <p>The solver uses a smarter strategy: <strong>start at any vertex, look at
        neighboring vertices, and walk to whichever one improves the objective.</strong>
        Repeat until no neighbor is better. That's the simplex method in one sentence.</p>

        <p>The plot above has more vertices than our factory problem. Drag the explorer
        point to each vertex and note its objective value.</p>
        <p>Now imagine starting at the origin (0, 0). The solver looks at the two edges
        leaving that vertex - one goes along the x-axis, the other along the y-axis.
        Which direction improves <code>3x + 5y</code> faster? The y-direction (coefficient 5
        is larger). So the solver walks up the y-axis to the next vertex.</p>
        <p>At each vertex, it repeats: "Which neighboring vertex is best?" When no neighbor
        is better, it stops - and it's guaranteed to be at the global optimum.</p>
